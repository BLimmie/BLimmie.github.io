# Summary

UCSB Students have problems planning out their schedule because of convoluted prerequisites for classes and confusing major and general education requirements. We wanted to build a web application that helps streamline the process while checking to make sure that the plan for all 4 years at UCSB was a valid set of classes.

This was a project for a class CS48: Computer Science Project. This was made in Spring 2018
