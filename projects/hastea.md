# Summary

College students in central California have a consistent problem of terrible boba shops in the local areas. We built a proof-of-concept web application that allows students to create a marketplace for boba delivery every time someone goes to the Bay Area or the Los Angeles area. 

This was a submission to SB Hacks V and won the following awards:
* Best Ruby on Rails app
* Best Domain Name
