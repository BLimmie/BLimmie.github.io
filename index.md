title: About Me
---

Hi there! I'm Brian Lim, a senior undergraduate/freshman Master's student majoring in Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara. Most of my work primarily focuses on **Machine Learning Engineering**, for which I have experience creating predictive models, and I also have a deep understanding of Deep Learning (pun intended). 

I currently serve as the **President** of **Data Science UCSB**, a club dedicated to teaching students about Data Science and providing the resources for creating projects within the realm. We are currently the largest educational organization at UCSB, serving over 250 members. If you would like to help students build a project or come do a talk about your company and how they use Data Science in the industry, please [email me](mailto:brian01.lim@gmail.com), and I would be happy to talk about any aspect of our organization and potential events.

I have interned in the past at **Workday** and **Muncaster Consulting**. 

At **Workday**, I built a project taking metric logs from Workday's data sources and created a data engineering pipeline to parse those logs and store them in a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) as well as a MySQL database.

At **Muncaster Consulting**, I worked with **FLIR**'s image processing and object detection SDK. I built the entire functional and performance testing suite that is still used to make sure their SDK is working deterministically and monitors changes to models' speed and accuracy.
